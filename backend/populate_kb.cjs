  { question: "Explain the concept of recursion.", answer: "Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve smaller instances of the same problem, ending when it reaches a base case." },
  { question: "What is a hash table?", answer: "A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values for highly efficient lookup, using a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets." },
  { question: "What is the difference between Git and GitHub?", answer: "Git is a local version control system that tracks changes to files. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets individuals and teams manage Git repositories online." },
  
  // History

  { question: "What was the Renaissance?", answer: "The Renaissance was a fervent period of European cultural, artistic, political, and economic 'rebirth' following the Middle Ages, typically spanning the 14th to the 17th century." },
  { question: "What was the Industrial Revolution?", answer: "The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in Europe and the United States from about 1760 to 1840, marked by the shift from hand production to machines." },
  { question: "When did the French Revolution happen?", answer: "The French Revolution took place between 1789 and 1799, leading to the overthrow of the monarchy, the establishment of a republic, and the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte." },
  { question: "What was the Cold War?", answer: "The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies, spanning roughly from 1947 to 1991." },
  { question: "Who wrote the Declaration of Independence?", answer: "Thomas Jefferson was the principal author of the Declaration of Independence, which was adopted by the Second Continental Congress on July 4, 1776." },
  { question: "What was the Magna Carta?", answer: "The Magna Carta was a royal charter of rights agreed to by King John of England in 1215, establishing the principle that everyone, including the king, was subject to the law." },
